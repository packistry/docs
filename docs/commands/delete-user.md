# Delete User Command

The `delete:user` command is used to delete one or more users. This command allows you to search for and select users to remove from your system.

## How to Run the Command

To run the command, use the following command:

```bash
packistry delete:user
```

## Steps

When you run the command, you will follow these steps:

### 1. **Select Users**
You will be prompted to select the users to delete. A search feature allows you to filter users by name and select the ones you want to remove.

### 2. **Confirmation**
Before proceeding, you will be asked to confirm the deletion of the selected users. If you confirm, the deletion will proceed; otherwise, the command will be canceled.

### 3. **User Deletion**
Once confirmed, the selected users will be deleted, and a message will be displayed for each user that has been removed.

## Example Output

After successfully deleting the users, you will see output similar to:

```bash
User John Doe deleted
User Jane Smith deleted
```

This confirms that the selected users have been successfully deleted.
